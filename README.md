This a perosnal project designed to run an in home-karaoke show for guests.  To find a song to add to a singer's queue, 
enter a title and/or artist and click the search icon to search YouTube for an appropriate video. Then enter the url and
click the add song button.  Under Now Singing, the play button launches the next karaoke song in the singer's queue in
another tab and the next button rotates the singer queue to the next singer.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
